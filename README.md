# Web development 2 - curriculum

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to modern web development, covering both back-end and front-end technologies as well as touching on deployment and testing practices. Students will gain hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using a set of modern frameworks and tools, preparing them for real-world software development scenarios. By the end of the course, students will have built a fully functional web application, gaining a deeper understanding of how different parts of a web application interact and how to test and deploy their applications.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have successfully finished the WD1 course or have a similar level of understanding of basic web technologies. They have to understand HTML and CSS, know how to program in Python, be able to build a monolithic application using Flask, understand the basics of HTTP protocol and about web APIs.
